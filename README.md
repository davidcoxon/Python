## about david coxon

Hi, and Welcome to my Python Repository on Github. I’m David Coxon and I’m Head of IT at BALTIC Centre of Contemporary Art, Gateshead in the North East of England. 

I started writing code using ‘Basic’ in the 80’s when my parents bought me my first computer, a Commodore Vic 20. Some 35 years on and i’m still learning to code, this time in Python.

## about this repository

I intended to use this repository as somewhere I can share my experiences, code and projects as I journey into the world of Python. Predominantly I will be using Python for Data Analysis, Machine Learning and Statistics.

The repository is divided into 2 parts, [Reference](https://github.com/davidcoxon/Python/tree/master/Reference) and [Projects](https://github.com/davidcoxon/Python/tree/master/Projects). Both folders are working directories that I will be constantly updating as I discover new areas of interest. 

Over time I hope the Reference folder will build to become a useful resource I can refer back when reviewing my learning. It will included recommended reading, links to useful data sources, lists of Python libraries and notes on different statistical models.

The Projects directory is meant as a place where I can experiment with the different techniques that I am learning, and get feedback from the Python community on how I can improve upon them in real world environments. 

There are now both Python and Data Science groups that meet regularly in Newcastle area and as I develop my Data Science skills and ability to code in Python, I hope to work on more collaborate projects.
